To launch the presentation:

1.  Open the .html file in Chrome.
1.  If necessary, unblock pop-ups from the .html file.
1.  Refresh Chrome to get it to open the presenters window.
1.  Move the presenters window to a second screen.
1.  Ensure that focus is on the presenters window.
1.  Press `p` to enter presenter mode.

You are ready to present.

Advance the slides using arrow keys or PgUp/PgDn. 

Clicking on slides in the presenters window will _not_ advance the
slides in the main window.
