# Part 1: The Reproducibility Crisis in Science

## The Experiment Experiment

- Attempt to test the veracity of scientific research.
- One hundred peer-reviewed published research papers.
- A team of investigators set out to replicate the findings.


## The Results

- Only <b>29</b> of the experiments could be replicated.


## The Aftermath

- Other investigators conducted similar experiments . . .
- . . . with similar results. 
- Feeling assailed, the statistics community responded.


## Principles of Reproducible Research

- Roger Peng (Johns Hopkins) and principles of Reproducible Research.\*
- Research must be accompanied by code and data.
- The research paper by itself is only an advertisement.

\* Reproducible Research in Computational Science, Science, Dec, 2011


## Reproducible Research

An article about computational science in a scientific publication is
not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship.

Dave Donoho, Stanford University
                                                                                   

## RMarkdown and Knitr 1

- Needed a way to bring research paper, the code, and the data togeter.
- RMarkdown: extensions to enable Markdown to embed executable code.
- Knitr: tool that builds the RMarkdown to various output formats.


## RMarkdown and Knitr 2

## Language Support in Knitr

- R
- C / C++
- Python
- Ruby
- Perl
- Bash
- And others . . .

Notably absent: 

- Java 
- C#

**Complete list of supported languages**

## Examples: Bash 

```{bash}
ls
```

## Similar Technologies

- [knitpy](https://github.com/janschulz/knitpy/blob/master/README.md) (and [stitch](https://github.com/pystitch/stitch/blob/master/README.rst))
- Jupyter Notebooks (supports Python, R, and other languages)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar-static-top/#)
- Storyteller

<div class="notes">

I am demo'ing R because I am most familiar with R.

Nice example of simultaneous invention.

## The Takeaway

Code that the document references lives inside the document . . .

. . . and be executable in the context of the document.

## Get the Electoral Votes 1

Ref: [Current electoral vote distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)#Current_electoral_vote_distribution) 


## Get the Electoral Votes 2

Python code to retrieve electoral votes.

```{python}
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import urllib2
import re
 
#
# Need the following line to prevent 403 error on Wikipedia.
#
header  = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'} 

#
# Wikipedia page about the electoral college.
#
wiki    = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)#Current_electoral_vote_distribution"

request = urllib2.Request( wiki, headers = header )
page    = urllib2.urlopen( request )

#
# Parse the HTML
#
soup    = BeautifulSoup( page, "html.parser" )

#
# Find the table that shows the electoral votes.
#
table   = soup.find("table", { "class" : "wikitable" })

outfileName = "electoral-college.csv"
with open( outfileName, 'w' ) as folderOut:
  for row in table.findAll( "tr" ):
    cells = row.findAll( "td" )
    if 2 == len( cells ):
      if re.search( "=", cells[ 0 ].find( text = True ) ):
        continue
      for string in cells[ 1 ].strings: 
        states = string.split( "," )
        for state in states:
          state = state.strip()
          if len( state ) != 0:
            folderOut.write( cells[ 0 ].find( text = True ) + ", " )
            folderOut.write( state + "\n" )
```
