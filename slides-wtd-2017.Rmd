# Part 1: The Replication Crisis in Science

## The Experiment Experiment

A team of investigators set out to replicate the findings from
<b>hundred</b> peer-reviewed published research papers.

Only <b>29</b> of the experiments could be replicated.

## Further Studies...Similar Results

According to a 2016 poll of 1,500 scientists reported in the journal
Nature, 70% of them had failed to reproduce at least one other
scientist's experiment and 50% had failed to reproduce one of their own
experiments. 

chemistry: 90% (60%),
biology: 80% (60%),
physics and engineering: 70% (50%),
medicine: 70% (60%),
Earth and environment science: 60% (40%).


## Replication Crisis

Replication crisis
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The replication crisis (or replicability crisis) refers to a
methodological crisis in science in which scientists have found that the
results of many scientific experiments are difficult or impossible to
replicate on subsequent investigation, either by independent researchers
or by the original researchers themselves.


## The Aftermath: Reproducible Research

Feeling assailed, the statistics community responded.

Roger Peng (Johns Hopkins) proposed the idea of Reproducible Research.\*

- Replication, the ability to re-enact the experiment was too high a
  bar.

- Instead, Reproducibility, the ability to reach the same conclusions
  given the same data and computational software.

- Reproduciblity requires that any published research make available
  both data that was collected and the code that processed the data.

## Reproducible Research

An article about computational science in a scientific publication is
not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising the scholarship.

Dave Donoho, Stanford University
                                                                                   

## Integrating the Code with the Writing

One of the barriers to reproducible research is that the code used to
produce the research is usually maintained separately from the research
paper itself.

The paper is published, but the code becomes . . . misplaced.

The solution was to find a way to _keep the research paper and the code
together_.

RMarkdown
Extensions to enable Markdown to embed executable code.

Knitr
Tool that builds the RMarkdown to various output formats.

## Reproducibility Ecosystem

- RMarkdown, Knitr
- GitHub
- Make




## The Takeaway

Code that the document references lives inside the document . . .

. . . and is executable in the context of the document.
