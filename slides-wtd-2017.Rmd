# Part 1: The Reproducibility Crisis in Science

## The Experiment Experiment

- Attempt to test the veracity of scientific research.
- One hundred peer-reviewed published research papers.
- A team of investigators set out to replicate the findings.


## The Results

- Only <b>29</b> of the experiments could be replicated.


## The Aftermath

- Other investigators conducted similar experiments . . .
- . . . with similar results. 
- Feeling assailed, the statistics community responded.


## Principles of Reproducible Research

- Roger Peng (Johns Hopkins) and principles of Reproducible Research.\*
- Research must be accompanied by code and data.
- The research paper by itself is only an advertisement.

\* Reproducible Research in Computational Science, Science, Dec, 2011


## Reproducible Research

An article about computational science in a scientific publication is
not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship.

Dave Donoho, Stanford University
                                                                                   

## RMarkdown and Knitr 1

- Needed a way to bring the research paper, code, and data together.
- RMarkdown: extensions to enable Markdown to embed executable code.
- Knitr: tool that builds the RMarkdown to various output formats.


## RMarkdown and Knitr 2

## Reproducibility Ecosystem

- RMarkdown, Knitr
- GitHub
- Make


## Example: Python

```{python}
import sys;
target_file = open( "number.txt" );

n = 5

for i in range( n ):
    print( i**2 )
```


## Language Support in Knitr

- R
- C / C++
- Python
- Ruby
- Perl
- Bash
- And others . . .

## Similar Technologies

- [knitpy](https://github.com/janschulz/knitpy/blob/master/README.md) (and [stitch](https://github.com/pystitch/stitch/blob/master/README.rst))
- Jupyter Notebooks (supports Python, R, and other languages)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar-static-top/#)
- Storyteller

<div class="notes">

I am demo'ing R because I am most familiar with R.

Nice example of simultaneous invention.

## The Takeaway

Code that the document references lives inside the document . . .

. . . and is executable in the context of the document.
