# Part 1: The Reproducibility Crisis in Science

## The Experiment Experiment




## The Results

- Only 29 of the experiments could be replicated.


## Reproducible Research

- Roger Peng and principles of Reproducible Research
- The paper by itself is only an advertisement
- Research must be accompanied by code and data


## Reproducible Research

An article about computational science in a scientific publication is
not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship.

# Part 3: Social Discourse, Misinformation, and Fake News

<font color='blue'>"There has been a great deal of hype surrounding
neural networks, making them seem magical and mysterious. As we make clear in this section, they are just nonlinear statistical models..." (ESL, p.392)</font>
