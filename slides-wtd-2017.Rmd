# Part 1: The Replication Crisis in Science

## The Experiment Experiment 1

In 2008, team of investigators led by Brian Nosek set out to replicate
the findings from <b>hundred</b> peer-reviewed published research papers
in the area of psychology.

NPR later referred to Nosek's work as <i>The Experiment Experiment</i>.

## The Experiment Experiment 3

Only <b>39</b> of the experiments could be replicated.


<!--
## More Studies...Similar Results

According to a 2016 poll of 1,500 scientists reported in the journal
Nature, 70% of them had failed to reproduce at least one other
scientist's experiment and 50% had failed to reproduce one of their own
experiments. 

chemistry                      |  90% (60%)
biology                        |  80% (60%)
physics and engineering        |  70% (50%)
medicine                       |  70% (60%)
Earth and environment science  |  60% (40%)

## Replication Crisis

The <b>replication crisis</b> (or replicability crisis) refers to a
methodological crisis in science in which scientists have found that the
results of many scientific experiments are difficult or impossible to
replicate on subsequent investigation, either by independent researchers
or _by the original researchers themselves_.

## Reproducible Research 1

<!--

Roger Peng (Johns Hopkins) proposed the idea of Reproducible Research.\*

- <i>Replication</i>, the ability to re-enact the experiment was too
  high a bar.

- Instead, <i>Reproducibility</i>, the ability to reach the same
  conclusions given the same data and computational software.

- Reproduciblity requires that any published research make available
  both data that was collected and the code that processed the data.


\* Reproducible Research in Computational Science, Science, Dec, 2011


## Reproducible Research 2

An article about computational science in a scientific publication is
not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising the scholarship.

Dave Donoho, Stanford University
                                                                                   

## Enabling Reproducible Research

One of the barriers to reproducible research is that the code used to
produce the research is usually maintained separately from the research
paper itself.

The paper is published, but the code becomes . . . misplaced.

The solution was to find a way to _keep the research paper and the code
together_.


## RMarkdown and Knitr 1


<b>RMarkdown</b></br>
Extensions to enable Markdown to embed executable code.


<b>Knitr</b></br>
Tool that builds the RMarkdown to various output formats.


## RMarkdown and Knitr 2

## Reproducibility Ecosystem

- RMarkdown, 
- Knitr
- GitHub


## The Takeaway

Code that supports the document is embedded in the document and is
executed when the document is built.

## Keeping Docs and Sample Code Separate

- Verifying that the code snippets in the docs work.
- Keeping the code snippets in the docs synch'd with the actual code.
- Providing the customer with enough information to reproduce the result.

## Similar Technologies: Knitpy

- [knitpy](https://github.com/janschulz/knitpy/blob/master/README.md) (and [stitch](https://github.com/pystitch/stitch/blob/master/README.rst))
- Similar to Knitr, but with enhanced support for Python.


## Similar Technologies: Jupyter Notebooks

  - Interactive code mixed with expository text.
  - Supports Python, R, and other languages.

## Similar Technologies: Bootstrap

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar-static-top/#)
- The HTML documentation for Bootstrap uses Bootstrap for styling.

## Fake News vs Verifiable News


## Example: How close was the election really?

What if 1% of those who votes for Donald Trump--on a state-by-state
basis had voted for Hillary Clinton instead?

We have all the information we need to answer the question and publish
the result.
